About:-

This project showcases a simple and least complicated browser chat-box interface. It lets you send/receive real-time data. Using Node.js,
a server is hosted in the port-number - '5000'. The server is hosted under the site 'https://localhost:5000'. Using the web framework - Express.js,
the webpage is designed and routes are handled. Connection between the .html and .js is established using the Express framework.
Socket.io enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser,
and a server-side library for Node.js.
